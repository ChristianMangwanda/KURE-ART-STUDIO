# Pre-Deployment Checklist for Kure Art Studio

## ✅ Completed Items

### Code Quality & Cleanup
- [x] Removed test file `src/lib/api-test.ts`
- [x] Commented out console.log statements (kept console.error for debugging)
- [x] Fixed TypeScript `any` types in validation functions
- [x] Fixed UTF-8 encoding issues in checkout page
- [x] Proper TypeScript typing for API routes

### Environment & Security
- [x] Created `.env.local.template` with all required variables
- [x] Stripe keys properly configured for production use
- [x] AWS environment variables defined
- [x] Database and email configuration prepared

## ⚠️ Remaining Tasks

### Critical Issues to Fix Before Launch
- [ ] **Fix artwork availability property inconsistency**
  - Current issue: Code uses `artwork.availability` (string) but TypeScript expects `artwork.available` (boolean)
  - Recommendation: Add `availability: 'available' | 'sold' | 'reserved'` to Artwork interface

### Final Deployment Steps
- [ ] Create actual `.env.local` file with production values
- [ ] Set production Stripe keys (STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
- [ ] Configure AWS credentials for S3/CloudFront
- [ ] Run final `npm run build` to verify no errors
- [ ] Test payment processing in Stripe test mode
- [ ] Configure domain and SSL certificate
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error tracking
